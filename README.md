ðŸ“¦ Inventory.API
Inventory.API is a microservice responsible for managing product-related data within the system. It is built using the Vertical Slice Architecture combined with the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability.

This service exposes HTTP endpoints that allow clients to create, update, retrieve, and delete product records, acting as the central source of truth for all inventory-related operations.

The service is containerized using Docker and communicates with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. Each feature in the application is implemented as a vertical slice, bundling its UI entry point, application logic, domain rules, and infrastructure in a single cohesive unit.
